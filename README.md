# bashtray

Bashtray is a bash script automation framework.
It helps to get quality, feature-rich bash scripts up-and-running quickly.
Bashtray 1.0 is completed but not fully tested.
I have archived the project to GitHub for possible future reference.

## Instructions

1. Include bashtray source in same directory as your script.
2. See sample foo script.
3. See sample foo-help-output.
